# **Using Technology to *Figure* out Real Estate Lending**
## *Figure was founded in  2018 and uses blockchain technology to streamline financial services, specifically real estate lending.  The company started with a home equity loan product and has since expanded into mortgage refinance, licensing a loan origination system, a loan marketplace, asset securitization and private fund services, all utilizing its Provenance blockchain.*

***Figure Technologies Inc*** was founded by CEO Mike Cagney who is also the founder of SoFi, a succesful online finance company offering several personal banking products. Figure was extablished with the goal of building a blockchain based business.  According to CEO Mike Cagney in an interview by Coindesk, "we ended up creating our lending business first and foremost as a way to create a forcing function for the blockchain." Figure initially identified home equity lending as the starting point for its business to be run on Provenance blockchain. Upon becoming established in the home equity lending product, the company further leveraged the Provenance platform to support a loan marketplace, as well as to securitize and sell bonds backed by the home mortgages it originates.  

In May of 2018, Figure raised just over $50 million via venture capital firms Ribbit Capital and DCM Ventures.  Since then it has held several additional funding initiatives and continues to partner with venture capital firms to raise funds, including an additional $103 million in late 2019. At the time of this last fudinng raise, the company had a $1.2 billion valuation. 

## Business Activities
Figure is trying to reduce cost inefficiencies, eliminate manual processes and digitize traditionally paper based lending processes. The HELOC product specifically is advertised as being a completely digital transaction, including an online application and same day approval, with online notary available, phone support if needed and funding in as little as 5 days. By specifically marketing these qualities, Figure is directly comparing itself to the traditional banking sector which is known to include extensive paperwork, prolonged approval and funding processes, and onerous requirements. Furthermore, by eliminating these manual processes, Figure is trying to save costs compared to other lenders. 

Relative to its loan sales and securitizations business, Figure is using blockchain to cut out intermediary parties that take various fees for their input into the securitization process, thereby reducing the cost of the overall transaction. The securitizations process is typically overseeen by an issuing agent (often an investment bank), but also invovles several other third parties such as a servicer, trustee, tax and accounting advisors, paying agent, and parties involved in recording custody of the underlying mortgages and newly created security. By serving several of these functions in-house and by using Provenance to record the chain of custody, Figure can reduce the total cost outlay of securitization.     

For its HELOC (Home equity line of credit) product, Figure is targeting everyday consumers and homeowners. As it expands in to payment services, loan securitizations, and other more complex services its targeting institutional investors and large corporations. Figure also actively licenses Figure SaaS (software as a service), a loan origination system integrated into Provenance, to other consumer real estate lenders. 

The potential market for Figure's current and potential products is enormous, and has yet to undergo significant digital or technological innovation. Speaking to mortgage lending and securitizations alone, the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates the origination volume for HELOCs at $496 billion in total credit extended in 2019, with $228 billion in outstanding borrowings. Home lending volumes fluctuate considerably with market rate changes and home values, and so these figures fluctuate significantly from year to year. Relative to the securitizations market, according the SIFMA (Securities Industry Financial Market Association) the total size of the MBS (mortgage backed securities) market was $10.4 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2020, and an additional $1.5 trillion in ABS (asset backed securities).

The company's primary technology is its Provenance blockchain. Blockchain, as simply defined by Investopedia is "a distributed, decentralized, public ledger." In the case of HELOC lending, Provenance records steps in the application process and serves as a ledger for various parties to certify and verify when key actions and approvals take place. The value of the blockchain becomes even more important when facilitating a loan marketplace, and for securitizing these real estate transactions for sale to institutional investors. In these instances, Provenance both records information about the underlying real estate asset, and also serves as the official record for certified purchases and sales of the created loan or security.  

 According to Provenance's website, the blockchain was built by the team at Figure, and "is a distributed stakeholder blockchain whose original underpinnings were IBM's Hyperledger Fabric." Figure stated it made modifications to the IBM version, removing certain functionalities and adding additional transactional validation capabilities to make it more useful for the financial services industry. Its website further states that Provenance is decentralized so that any agent can use API (application programming interface) to write smart contracts on it.

In addition to the Provenance blockchain, the company also uses artifical intelligence and analytics in its loan origination, sales and securitization processes. For example, Figure actively uses Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) in lieu of appraisals to assess the value of the underlying real estate securing the home equity line.  AVMs use machine learning and artificial intelligence to evaluate the characteristics of a home, coupled with nearby sales data to come up with a valuation estimate without having to engage or pay an actual person to complete an on-site appraisal. Analytical and predictive models are also extremely important in the securitization process.  Securitizatoin is a highly complex process that requires firms to apply risk methodologies to group loans into rated tranches based on analytical estimates of default rates, runoff and payoff volumes, and payment performance. Additional analytical information is needed to to price these securities appropriately once created, and then track how the behavior of individual loans in the securitization pool impact the security value through payment reductions, payoffs, defaults and foreclosures. 

## Landscape

Figure operates within several domains of FinTech as it relates to the financial industry: 
- Mortgage/real estate
- Lending
- Blockchain
- Personal finance  

Speaking specifically to the company's initial and primary product, HELOC lending, Home equity lending volumes are closely tied to interest rate changes and the stability of the residential real estate market. Low interest rates over the last 5-10 years and increases in residential real estate values following the great recession have led to volume increases in mortgage lending markets.  

In terms of innovation and technology, the HELOC industry has not seen significant changes over the last decade. One impact of technology on the industry has been the use of AVMs, which offer a lower cost option compared to a traditional appraisal of valuing the collateral value of the home. Lenders are beginning to use increasingly automated processes in mortgage lending to streamline and process applications digitally with things like automated quality control checks and digital signatures on mortgage documents; however these changes have not been significant disruptors to the existing process due to the significant regulations and compliance requirements. For example, Figure offers customers the option of using an eNotary, whereby a certified notary can verify a customer's identify through video chat, however this process is not accepted in all counties and local jurisdictions. These restrictions and uncertainties can reduce any competitive edge or cost savings gained, as additional time and research is required to understand the influence of local regulations across multiple jurisdictions. Online lenders such as Rocket Mortgage are adding increasing  competition to real estate lending, through their ability to market products to customers though online means without requiring the customer to ever leave their home. Furthermore applications, paperwork and signatures are becoming increasingly digitally based. This has recently begun to reduce some costs associated with real estate lending, however many aspects of the real estate lending process remain largely manual and ripe for digital transformation and cost reductions - for example title work and lien searches, and recording of real estate purchases and sales in county records often still requires a level of manual intervention. 

The HELOC lending industry is a highly competitive industry, involving large and small banks, and several online lenders. Its a basic product offered by most financial institutions. Loan securitization services, by contrast, are often provided by only the largest banks and investment firms. This is a much more complex process that requires firms to apply risk methodologies to group loans into rated tranches based on analytical estimates of default rates, runoff and payoff volumes, and payment performance.  Once this is completed, additional analytical steps rae needed to to price these securities appropriately once created, and then track how the behavior of individual loans in the securitization pool impact the security value through payment reductions, payoffs, and default rates.

## Results 

Figure has made a tangible impact in the Home Equity lending space in a relatively short amount of time. The company does not openly publish information about its origination volumes, but states on its website that it has unlocked "over $1 billion in Equity" for homeowners. The company has often leveraged partnerships to achieve these results and increase its loan volumes. For example, the company partners with Quorum Federal Credit Union which offers Figure customers various deposit accounts.  Customers that open a deposit account receive a .50% discount on their loan. Beyond its origination volume, in March of this year, Figure completed its first blockchain based securitization of $150 million in loans. CEO Mike Cagney estated that Figure is able to save 120 basis points of value in the securitization process, by cutting out intermediary parties such as the paying agent or the custody bank due to its ability to track and record the transaction on Provenance. [^1] In August of 2020, the company also launched its Provenance Loan Marketplace for the buying and selling of loans. 

Mortgage lenders typically use origination volumes, combined with profitability indicators to measure their relative success at market penetration. As a private company, Figure does not publicly publish this information, and declined to disclose its revenue range in its 2019 filing wtih the SEC. Figure does charge both a fixed interest rate and origination fee (currently 3% to 4.99% of the first draw) on its HELOC loan product to obtain income, in addition to fees charged for licensing its loan origination system, and fees earned in the securitization and loan sales process. While its impossible to know Figure's true financial performance without actual audited financials, it clearly has the potential to be highly profitable given the volumes it's originating and the cost savings it claims to receive relative to other lenders. 

Figure is gaining momentum, but remains a new entrant to a very established and highly competitive home lending market. Restrictions in Figures loan size (up to $150,000) and the fact that it is not currently able to lend in all 50 states also restricts its current market penetration. Despite these challenges and its relatively young age, Figure is often mentioned as one of the top 10 consumer lenders in HELOC lending on popular consumer websites such as bankrate.com and consumersadvocate.org. 


##  Recommendations
If I were to advise Figure, I would suggest they continue to expand both their consumer and corporate product line. Mortgage lending is often considered the most burdensom type of lending from a regulatory compliance point of view - it involves title work and deed transfers, and multiple compliance disclosures. If they've mastered this process, expanding into other types of secured personal lending products - such as automobile lending would make sense, and eventually they could also consider unsecured lending products such as credit cards. The challenge would be loan funding. Right now, Figure is able to fund the loans it offers through its existing capital base, as well as by securitizing and selling securities backed by the loans it issues. If Figure ever ventures to expand into consumer deposit taking, it would need to apply for a banking license to explore this funding source for further expansion.  Expanding into other loan products would also align with its securitizations business. If Figure were to expand to non-real estate secured loans (such as car or boat loans) it could similarly expand into securitization of asset backed securities supported by the loans it originates. This would use largely the same technology its currently using, but with modifications to a different product base. For example, in the case of financing car loans, the company would need a valuation model that could estimate a market value for a car, similar to the AVM its currently using for real estate evaluation. 

The company could also expand its residential lending expertise into other personal finance and service areas not related to lending itself - for example, since HELOCs are often use for home improvement projects, it could use its platform to connect customers with trusted and reviewed home contractors, and even serve as a payment intermediary for these services. For example, a contractor could be paid directly by Figure via a draw on the HELOC line following the completion and verification of certain milestones such as an inspection of the home renovation work by a certified inspector. These certification steps and controls could be recorded on the Provenance blockchain. Draw controls on lines of credit are common in the commercial real estate lending industry but are often lacking in consumer home development and improvement. Figure's blockchain could serve as a digital ledger recording the completion and certification of these steps, and release of payment to an approved recipient. Again, it could largely leverage its existing technologies but may need to further build on and expand its payment platform.
