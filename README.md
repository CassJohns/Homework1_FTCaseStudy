FinTech Case Study - Figure 
# **Figure-ing Out Real Estate Lending**
## *Figure uses blockchain technology to streamline financial services.  Figure was founded in 2018.  It started by initially lauching a home equity loan product and other consumer lending and has since expanded into other financial services such mortgage refinance, as a loan origination system, a loan marketplace to buy and sell loans on blockchain, asset securitization and private fund services built upon its Provenance blockchain technology.* 

***Figure Technologies Inc***

The company was foudned by CEO Mike Cagney who also founded SoFi
The company wanted to force adoption of blockchain based business and started by first creating a home equity lending business to be run on its Provenance blockchain. 

In May of 2018, Figure raised just over $50 million via venture capital firms Ribbit Capital and DCM Ventures.  Since then it has held several additional funding initiatives, and continues to partner with venture capital firms to raise funds incuding raising an additional $103 million in late 2019. 

## Business Activities
*Figure is trying to reduce cost inefficiencies, eliminiate manual processes and digitize traditionally paper based lending processes. The HELOC product specifically is advertises as being a completely digital transaction, including an online application and same day approval, online notary available, phone support if needed and funding in as little as 5 days.  By specifically marketing these qualities, Figure is directly comparing itself to the traditional banking sector which is known to include extensive paperwork, prolonged approval and funding processes, and ornerous requirements.  

For its HELOC (Home equity line of credit) product, Figure is targeting everyday consumers and homeowners.  As it expands in to payment services, loan securitizations, and other more complex services it's targeting institutional investors and large corporations looking for cost savings as it uses its blockchain technology as the digital ledger for payment, trading, and real estate transactions.

The potential market for Figure's current and potential products is enormous, and has yet to undergo signficiant digital or technological innovation comparable to Figure's objectives. Speaking to mortage lending and securitizationa alone, the Mortgage Bankers Association estimates the origination volume for HELOCs at $496 billion in total credit extended in 2019, with $228 billion in outstanding borrowings.  Home lending volumes fluctuate considerably with market rate changes, and so volumes have continued to rise in 2020 with the low interest rate market coupled with a stable housing market. Relative to the securitizations market, according the SIFMA (Securities Industry Financial Market Association) the total size of the MBS (mortgage backed securities) market was $10.4 trillion at the end of the first quarter of 2020, and an additional $1.5 trillion in ABS (asset backed securities).

The company's primary technolgy is its Provenance blockchain.  Blockchain, as simply defined by Investopedia is "a distributed, decentralized, public ledger." In the case of HELOC lending, Provenance is used to both record steps in the application process, and serves as a ledger for various parties to certify and verify when key actions and approvals take place. The value of the blockchain becomes even more important when facilitating a loan market place, and for securitizing these real estate transactions for sale to instiutional investors.  Provenance is the means to record information about the underlying real estate asset, as well as serve as the official record for certified purchases and sales of the created security.  

 According to Provenance's website, it was built by the team at Figure, and "is a distributed stakeholder blockchain whose original underpinnings were IBM's Hyperledger Fabric."  Figure made modifications to the IBM version, removing certain functionalities and adding additional transactional validation capabilities to make it more useful for the financial services industry.  It's website further states that Provenance is decentralized so that any agent can use API (application programming interface) to write smart contracts on it.

In addition to the Provenance blockchain which serves as the primary underpinning technology of the Figure model, the company also licenses Figure SaaS (software as a service), which is a loan origination system integrated into Provenance. 

## Landscape

Figure operates within several domains of FinTech as it relates to the financial industry: 
- mortgage/real estate
- lending
- blockchain
- personal finance  

Speaking specifically to the company's initial and primary product, HELOC lending, this landscape is highly impactedy interest rate changes.  Home equity lending volumes are closely tied to interest rate changes and the stability of the residential real estate market. Low interest rates over the last 5-10 years, and increases in residential real estate values following the great recession have led to volume increases in the HELOC market. 

In terms of innovation and technology, the HELOC industry has not seen significant changes over the last decade. One impact of technology on the industry has bene the use of automated valuation models or AVMs, which offer a lower cost option compared to a traditional appraisal of valuing the collateral value of the home.  Lenders are beginning to use increasingly automated processes in HELOC lending to streamline the process and process applications ditigally with automated quality control checks and digital signatures on mortgage documents, but these changes have not been significant disruptions to the existing process due to the significant regulations and compliance needs involved. For example, Figure offers customers the option of using an eNotary, whereby a certified notary can verify a customer's identify through video chat, however this process is not accepted in all counties and local jurisdictions. Online lenders such as Rocket Mortgage are adding competition to real estate lending markets, and applications, paperwork and signatures are becoming more digitally based.  This has recently begun to reduce costs associated with real state lending, however many aspects of the real estate lending process remain largely manual and ripe for digital transformation - for example title work and lien searches, and recording of real estate purchases and sales in county records often still requires a level of manual intervention. 

The HELOC lending industry is a highly competitive industry, involving large and small banks, and several online lenders. It's a basic product offered by most financial institutions.  Loan securitization services, by contrast, are often provided by only the largest banks and investment firms with significant capital investment. 

## Results 

Figure has made a tangible impact in the Home Equity lending space in a relatively short amount of time.  The company does not openly publish information about it's origination volumes, but states on its website that it has unlocked "over $1 billion in Equity" for homeowners.  The company has often leveraged partnerships to achieve these reults and increase its loan volumes.  For example, the company partners wtih Quorum Federal Credit Union which offers Figure customers various deposit accounts.  Customers that open a deposit account receive a .50% discount on their loan. Figure also partners with other mortgage lenders.  Beyond it's origination volume, in March of this year, Figure completed its first blockchain based securitization of $150 million in loans.  In August of 2020, the company launched its Provenance Loan Marketplace for the buying and selling of loans. 

Mortgage lenders typically use origination volumes, combined with profitability indicators to measure their relative success at market penetration.  As a private company, Figure does not publicly publish this information.  Figure does charge both a fixed interest rate and origination fee (currently 3% to 4.99% of the first draw) on it's HELOC loan product to obtain income, in addition to fees charged for licensing its loan origination system, and fees earned in the securitization and loan sales proces. While Figure is gaining momentum, it's still a new entrant to a very established and highly competitive market, and likely has a very small marketshare compared to the larger mortgage lenders.  Restrictions in Figures loan size (up to $150,000) and the fact that it is not currently able to lend in all 50 states also restricts its current market penetration. 


##  Recommendations
If I were to advise Figure, I would suggest they continue to expand both their consumer and corporate prodcut line.  From a consumer point of view, mortgage lending is often considered the most burdensom type of lending from a regulatory compliance point of view - it involves title work and deed transfers, multiple compliance disclosures. If they've mastered this process, expanding into other types of secured personal lending products - such as automobile lending would make sense, and eventually they could also consider unsecured lending products such as credit cards. The challenge would be loan funding. Right now, Figure is able to fund the loans it offers through it's existing capital base, as well as by securitizing and selling securities backed by the loans it issues.  The securitizations market is typically connected only to secured lending.  Therefore it makes sense that Figure could expand to non-real estate loans that are still collaterlized (such as car or boat loans) and similarly expand in the securitization market to asset backed securities supported by the loans it originates.  This would use largely the same technology it's currently using, but with modifications to a different product base. For example, in the case of financing car loans, the company would need a valuation model that could estimate a market value for a car, similar to the AVM it's currently using for real estate evaluation. 

The company could also expand its residential lending expertise into other personal finance and service areas not related to lending itself - for example, since HELOCs are often use for home improvement projects, it could use its platform to connect customers with trusted and reviewed home contractors, and even serve as a payment intermediary for these services.  For example, a contractor could be paid directly by Figure via a draw on the HELOC line following the completion and verification of certain milestones such as an inspection of the home rennovation work by a certified inspector, as recorded on the Provenance blockchain.  These types of controls are common in the commercial real estate lending industry but are often lacking in consumer home development and improvement. Figure's blockchain could serve as a digital ledger recording the completion and certification of these steps, and release of payment to an approved recipient. Again, it could largely leverage its existing technologies but may need to further build on and expand its payment platform.
